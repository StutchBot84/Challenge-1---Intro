## Recommendations

### **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**
If Stripe were to expand into another service I would recommend providing an investment service portal. The ability for users to login and purchase stocks, crypto, bonds etc. They could then continue to take a small percentage of each trade, which is a similar business ode l to the payment processing business. 

### **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Stripe could utilise its existing payments solution to facilitate these investments. It would simply need to add an additional front end component to allow users to login and purchase stocks. With its focus on programming languages Ruby and Javascript this should be possible. 

### **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
This service would utilise its exsting payment APIs. It would also be built using Ruby and Javascript which has already been used. Pthon may also be used as its often used to build competing stock exchanges. 

### **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
These technologies have already been used previously by Stripe, and mean thay do not have to reinvent the wheel when setting up the trading environment. This could also allow inetgration with its exsing payment processes. This would mean that potentially Stripe could earn money from the stock purchases and then from the payment processes.
